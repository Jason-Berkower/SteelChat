# Project Overview

## Project Name

SteelChat (`Working Name`)

## Project Description

Messaging applications help you stay in touch with friends, family, and coworkers alike! They've become a part of daily life, with all of us utilizing at least one form of messenger to facilitate communication every day. This messenger will continue to facilitate this communicative need whilst providing people with a place to safely express themselves through some kind of avatar.

## MVP

#### Planning

- Have a thoroughly developed README.md file. (Refer below to "Step 5: Pitch Your Project Idea" for more.)

#### React

- Be a working, interactive React app, built using create react app.
- Utilize React Router, installed via NPM.
- Have at least 6 separate, rendered components.
- Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
- Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
- Use Axios to consume data from Airtable, and GET/render that data in your components.
- Use Axios to POST/create new data on Airtable.
- Use only React for DOM Manipulation.

#### Styling

- Be styled, use any combination of CSS, Styled Components, CSS-in-JS, or a component library to style your React project.
- Use flexbox (display: flex) or CSS Grid (N/A if using a component library that handles this).
- Implement responsive design on 2 screen sizes, using a media query (desktop and mobile and N/A if using a component library that handles this).

#### Linting

- Indent properly.
- Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- Follow camelCase, kebab-case and PascalCase conventions.
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- Remove all console.log()s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are acceptable).

#### Deployment

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

- Ambition. This will drive me to pursue each goal I set out and reach for the stars. That's partially why I chose this as my project; I want an opportunity to take what I've learned and put it towards something complex and involved.
- Creativity. I can use my out-of-the-box thinking to address problems as they come up.
- ADHD. Even with its shortcomings, it has granted me the gift of hyperfocus when it comes to projects I'm interested in. I can get a lot done in a short span of time if I get into a groove.
- Determination/Grit. If I'm setting a goal for myself, I'm going to fight to achieve it. I'll fight to hit that goal and even go above and beyond.

### Weaknesses:

- Ambition. As with project one, it's possible that I'll set goals that are a little too lofty and find myself scrambling to finish certain things at the last moment.
- ADHD. While it allows me to hyperfocus on things I'm interested in, there's always the lingering threat of getting super distracted and losing track of time. I have strategies set up to mitigate this as much as possible, but it still bears mentioning.
- Stubbornness. I've bashed my head against problems that felt like they took hours to finish. I've sat in frustration over trying to get certain aspects of an app to function how I want them to. This can certainly get in the way of further progress.
- Overthinking. This is something I'm working on breaking, but its a difficult road to travel. I can definitely find myself stumbling over myself when trying to implement certain components or when trying to get different elements of an app to interact with each other.

### Opportunities:

- Securing a concrete understanding of the concepts and practices I've learned throughout the course.
- Gaining the ability to strike out and experiment.
- Build a project I can show off proudly in its "course-finished" state, then show off post-course in its "use-ready" state.

### Threats:

- The world could end.
- I can try using something like bootstrap and end up completely wrecking my application.
- I might just break my application in general because of human error.
- My goals might be too unrealistic at this time.

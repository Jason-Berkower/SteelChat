# Project Overview

## Project Name

SteelChat (`Working Name`)

## Project Description

Messaging applications help you stay in touch with friends, family, and coworkers alike! They've become a part of daily life, with all of us utilizing at least one form of messenger to facilitate communication every day. This messenger will continue to facilitate this communicative need whilst providing people with a place to safely express themselves through some kind of avatar.

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## Component Hierarchy

Show your component hierarchy here! Use [this](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1795/posts/30352/image/GettingStartedWithReduxTutorial-React-Component-Structure.png) as an example.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This **must** be properly formatted. An example is below:

```
Currently Empty
```
